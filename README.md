# About The Programs

## Capstone Project
This is the capstone project that I was team leader for in a group with 4 other students developing for a not-for-profit client. To sum up the program quickly it takes a video input and provides a selection of line drawing outputs in the form of an SVG file which can be edited in other programs such as Photoshop. This program primarily made use of OpenCV to achieve these results. I was responsible for designing the program, its workflow, research, developing demo modules for later implamentation and file handling.

## Cat Detection
First time using Ultralytics YOLO for a cat detection program. I want to dig deeper into this, but this program is a proof of concept for me as I created this to test object recognition when used with noisey footage.

## Internship Project
This is a Django webpage with a machine learning model and database where users can upload a dataset in a zip folder to train and make predictions with the machine learning model for image classification tasks. The locations of the files within the uploaded dataset are stored within an SQL database for future access. The model once trained is also saved and can be loaded in and used for classifiyig uploaded images. This made use of a pipe dataset and identify which ones are faulty.

## Web Scraping Demo
This program was made as part of my university study. In this task I needed to create a way to create a custom weighting for a theoretical stock market model. The idea behind this was to get data about company X based on social media discussions and have specific key works add positive weighting (positive talk about the company) based on the number of times they occur within a post and negative words which will detract from this weighting (negative discussion of the company). The only problem with this idea is that a lot of websites do not want you to scrape them and can blacklist you. I did not want to do this, so I made use of the Romeo and Juliete script to be my stand in for a social media discussion. So, words that are related to love and positive and words that relate to death are negative words for the sake of this task.

## Collection Manager
