# About The Programs

## Capstone Project - Proof of Concept System
Video input to selection of SVG output with user interface buit for a not-for-profit client. This program was built primarily with OpenCV. I was responsible for creating the softwares design and workflow, developing demo modules and later implementation. Team leader university project with group of 4 other students.

- OpenCV
- Python
- Windows exe
- Numpy
- Tkinter

### Status
Completed project delivered and deployed with client.


## Cat Detection - Proof of Concept
First time using Ultralytics YOLO to explore the usage of object detection with a custom dataset. Model was then tested on noisy footage captured from a drone to see the effectiveness of good testing data when applied to poor live footage.

- Python
- Ultralytics Yolo
- Pandas
  
#### Status
Still in development. Exploring available hyperparameters for tuning. Investigating reasons for false positives. Exploring how to apply to a live analog video feed.


## Internship Project
Webpage with SQL database and Machine Learning (ML) model. Users can upload a dataset in a zip file to train an ML model. Model can then be loaded in to perform categorisation tasks. In this project it was to identify faulty pipes.

- Python
- Django
- Pandas
- Tensorflow
- SQL
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Sklearn
- Numpy

### Status
Completed project before set deadline during internship period. Looking at the project now I think I could improve this now with a better training pipeline and data augmentation.


## Web Scraping Demo
University project to demonstrait usage of web scraping for creating custom data weighting multipliers for predictive models based on key words. The script for Romeo and Juliet was used for this.

- Python
- Beautiful Soup

### Status
Completed assignment. I plan to create a more in depth scraper in the future for Runescape grand exchange profit margins for flipping.


## Collection Manager
University mobile app development project. Working prototype app for keeping track of a militaria collection with full CRUD functionality.

- Android
- Kotlin
- SQLite

### Status
Completed project and installed on my own device. Might do some more work in the future for extra categories, more sorting options, better user interface and improved data population speed when changing activities.
